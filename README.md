# doublecircle
This project analyzes the shift in residential preferences caused by teleworking since the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a survey in Tokyo, we identified a nonlinear effect of population density on relocation intention. Our results suggest that these preferences may form a "double-circle structure" in large metropolitan areas.
